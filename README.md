# Skill Recorder

**Record yourself doing a task once — turn it into a skill your AI agent can repeat.**

Skill Recorder captures a real work session on your screen — the clicks, the app and
window switches, the pages you visit, and (if you want) your spoken narration — then uses
the **GitHub Copilot CLI** to reconstruct *what you actually did* as a clear **intent plus
an ordered list of steps**. From there, one step turns that single run into something an
agent can reuse:

- a **Skill** — a `SKILL.md` procedure an agent runs on demand, or
- an **Automation** — the same procedure on a schedule or trigger.

Both prefer the agent's **native tools** (like the `gh` CLI or `web_fetch`) over replaying
UI clicks, and generalize from your one example — so recording yourself submitting *one*
form can teach the agent to submit *all* of them.

## How it works

1. 🔴 **Record** — Hit record (or `⌘⇧R` / `Ctrl+Shift+R` from anywhere) and just do your
   task. Skill Recorder captures your screen and activity locally, in the background.
2. 🎛️ **Control** — While recording, a small always-on-top bar shows capture and
   microphone state. Mute, unmute, or switch mics on the fly, then finish — or discard
   (with a confirmation) if the take didn't go to plan.
3. 🧠 **Analyze** — Click Analyze and GitHub Copilot reconstructs one overall intent and
   an ordered list of steps. Review and edit until it reads right.
4. ✨ **Create** — From an approved analysis, generate a reusable **Skill** and/or a
   scheduled **Automation**.

## Get started

The quickest path: one command downloads Skill Recorder, sets it up, builds it, and
launches it. It's **safe to re-run** — the same command updates your install to the latest
version and only does work when something actually changed.

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adilei/skill-recorder/master/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adilei/skill-recorder/master/install.ps1 | iex
```

You'll need **Node.js 22+** and the **GitHub Copilot CLI** signed in first (see
[Requirements](#requirements)). On first launch, macOS asks for **Screen Recording**
permission — grant it and you're ready to record.

> ⚠️ **Keep secrets out of your recordings.** Don't record, type, paste, or narrate
> passwords, tokens, API keys, or other confidential info — choosing *Analyze* sends
> recording data to GitHub's cloud. Skill Recorder reminds you before every recording.

<details>
<summary>Install options &amp; updating</summary>

Prefix either command with any of these:

| Variable | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SKILL_RECORDER_HOME` | `~/.skill-recorder` | where the app is installed |
| `SKILL_RECORDER_REF` | `master` | branch, tag, or commit to install |
| `SKILL_RECORDER_NO_RUN` | *(unset)* | set up without launching |

Re-run the one-liner any time to update and relaunch. To relaunch without re-downloading,
run `npm start` from the install directory. The installer uses `git` when available and
falls back to a source tarball/zip download otherwise.

## Requirements

- **macOS** (primary target). Windows 11 x64 and ARM64 are also supported — see
  [`WINDOWS-VALIDATION.md`](WINDOWS-VALIDATION.md).
- **Node.js 22+**.
- **GitHub Copilot CLI**, installed and signed in, with `copilot` on your `PATH`. It
  powers the analysis and the skill/automation builders.
- No system media tools required — Chromium handles screen snapshots and narration audio
  decoding. A system `ffmpeg` is only used to open recordings made by an older Skill
  Recorder version that has no snapshot manifest.

On first launch macOS prompts for **Screen Recording** (required). Turning on **Narrate**
requests **Microphone** permission immediately so you can pick a named input before
recording; that permission-check stream is released without saving any audio.

## What gets captured

Recording, storage, frame extraction, and optional narration transcription all happen
**on your computer** — nothing leaves while you record. Only when you choose **Analyze**
does Skill Recorder send the event timeline (window/document titles, URLs, and clipboard
previews), extracted screen images, narration text, and anything else you provide to
GitHub's cloud service for Copilot to process.

> ⚠️ **Please don't capture secrets.** Passwords, access tokens, API keys, credentials, and
> other confidential information should never be recorded, typed, pasted, shown, copied,
> or narrated during a session.

The in-app "Records your screen and activity" panel spells out exactly what's collected:

- **Window tracking** — active-app / window switches (Koffi/Win32 on Windows,
  `get-windows` elsewhere).
- **Browser URLs** — the page you're on (macOS, via AppleScript).
- **Screen video** — recorded by Chromium; low-rate snapshots are captured alongside it
  and retained only when the screen changes or a heartbeat is due.
- **Clipboard** — short previews of copied text that tie steps together.
- **Narration** *(optional)* — turn on **Narrate** before capture or toggle the microphone
  from the floating recording bar. Narrate shows the active input and remembers a selected
  microphone, with an explicit **System default** fallback. During capture, the bar can
  switch inputs without interrupting screen recording; each microphone-on interval is
  timestamped on the video timeline, saved locally, and can be transcribed **on-device** in
  any of Whisper's 99 supported languages (via transformers.js), preserving the selected
  language. The first transcription uses an explicit, one-time ~252 MB model download. The
  multilingual q8 checkpoint is only about 0.6 MB larger than the previous English-only
  model and uses the same `small` architecture, so runtime memory and transcription speed
  are expected to remain effectively unchanged.

## Run from source (development)

Prefer to hack on the code instead of using the installer? Clone the repo and:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` starts Vite and launches the Electron app with hot-reload. The app also
lives in the menu-bar tray; `⌘⇧R` (macOS) / `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) toggles recording
from anywhere. On Windows, press `F12` while the recorder or Sessions window is focused to
toggle DevTools during development.

Other useful scripts:

```bash
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
npm run build       # typecheck + production build (dist/ + dist-electron/)
npm run dist        # build a non-Windows distributable via electron-builder
npm run dist:win:x64    # requires native Windows x64
npm run dist:win:arm64  # requires native Windows ARM64
npm start           # run the last build with `electron .`
```

## Evals

The variable part of the system — the Copilot **describer** and **builders** — has a
fixture-based eval suite. See [`evals/README.md`](evals/README.md).

```bash
npm run eval            # score the describer against synthetic recordings
npm run eval:builder    # score the skill/automation generalization
```
