# Third-Party Notices

Skill Recorder is licensed under the MIT License (see [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE)).

Packaged/distributed builds include third-party components that are covered by
their own license terms. This file summarizes the notable ones. Every supported
release command generates a complete, platform-specific compliance bundle under
`resources/compliance/` containing full package license texts, native notices,
copyleft license texts, corresponding source, and relinking instructions.
Electron's exact notices are retained under `resources/compliance/electron/`;
platforms that preserve Electron's root notice files carry those copies too.

The dependency tree is otherwise permissive (MIT, ISC, Apache-2.0, BSD,
BlueOak-1.0.0) and compatible with distributing this application under MIT.
Those components remain under their own terms; the generated
`THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.txt` preserves their license and attribution text.

## Optional downloaded model

### OpenAI Whisper small — `Xenova/whisper-small`
- The multilingual model is downloaded from
  [`Xenova/whisper-small`](https://huggingface.co/Xenova/whisper-small) only
  after explicit user approval; its weights are not bundled with Skill Recorder.
- The Transformers.js-compatible ONNX conversion is published by Xenova
  (Joshua Lochner) from OpenAI's
  [`openai/whisper-small`](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-small)
  checkpoint.
- The Hugging Face model metadata declares **Apache-2.0**. OpenAI's
  [Whisper repository](https://github.com/openai/whisper) also states that its
  code and model weights are released under the **MIT License**. The downloaded
  model remains subject to its publisher's applicable terms and does not change
  Skill Recorder's MIT license.

## Bundled runtime components

### GitHub Copilot CLI — `@github/copilot` (+ platform binary `@github/copilot-<platform>-<arch>`)
- License: **GitHub Copilot CLI License** (proprietary) — see
  `node_modules/@github/copilot/LICENSE.md`.
- Pulled in by `@github/copilot-sdk` (MIT) and spawned as a separate process.
- Redistribution is permitted **only** as an unmodified copy bundled as part of
  this application, with the license and all copyright/attribution notices
  retained. The license explicitly states it does not restrict this
  application's own license, including distribution under an open-source (MIT)
  license.

### Electron / Chromium media codecs
- License: Electron is **MIT**. Its Chromium runtime includes `ffmpeg.dll`
  (`libffmpeg.dylib` / `libffmpeg.so` on other platforms), a dynamically loaded
  codec library whose bundled notice identifies FFmpeg as **LGPL-2.1-or-later**.
  GPL portions require an explicit non-default FFmpeg build configuration.
- Electron's `LICENSE.electron.txt` and `LICENSES.chromium.html` are retained in
  every packaged application.
- The currently pinned source is Electron
  [`v43.1.1`](https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/v43.1.1), Chromium
  [`150.0.7871.114`](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/150.0.7871.114),
  and Chromium FFmpeg revision
  [`ad41607c61898cf7150e0fb20fe4bbabd44922a3`](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/third_party/ffmpeg/+/ad41607c61898cf7150e0fb20fe4bbabd44922a3).
  The Electron source archive and its applied FFmpeg patch queue accompany each
  release.
- Chromium records the WebM media, captures screen snapshots, and decodes
  narration audio. Skill Recorder does **not** distribute `ffmpeg-static` or a
  standalone FFmpeg executable.
- A user-installed standalone FFmpeg may be invoked only to read a recording
  created before snapshot manifests were introduced. That executable is not part
  of this app.

### Sharp / libvips — `sharp` and `@img/sharp-*`
- `sharp` is **Apache-2.0**. Its Windows native packages are
  **Apache-2.0 AND LGPL-3.0-or-later**; other platforms load the corresponding
  **LGPL-3.0-or-later** `@img/sharp-libvips-*` package.
- The currently pinned source is Sharp
  [`v0.34.5`](https://github.com/lovell/sharp/tree/v0.34.5), its reproducible
  packaging scripts
  [`sharp-libvips v1.2.4`](https://github.com/lovell/sharp-libvips/tree/v1.2.4),
  and libvips
  [`v8.17.3`](https://github.com/libvips/libvips/tree/v8.17.3). The unpacked
  native module remains replaceable in the packaged application.
- The native payload also contains libraries under MPL-2.0, MIT, BSD, ISC,
  fontconfig, FreeType, libpng, libtiff, zlib, and related permissive terms.
  The exact upstream table is distributed as
  `resources/compliance/NATIVE-THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`.

### ONNX Runtime

`onnxruntime-node`, `onnxruntime-web`, and `onnxruntime-common` are MIT. Their npm
packages omit standalone license and third-party-notice files, so exact notices
from each pinned source revision are included under
`resources/compliance/onnxruntime/`.

### Copyleft release materials

Redistributable builds include the complete GPL-3.0, LGPL-2.1, LGPL-3.0, and
MPL-2.0 texts. They also include source archives for Electron's FFmpeg revision,
Sharp, libvips, every library embedded in the Sharp native payload, the
applicable packaging repositories, and all externally applied build patches.
`SOURCE-MANIFEST.json` records the origin, version, SHA-256, and purpose of every
file. Every remote payload is checked against a reviewed SHA-256 before use;
the FFmpeg archive is deterministically generated from its pinned Git commit.
`RELINKING.md` identifies platform-specific unpacked shared-library locations
and explains how to rebuild and replace them.

### Other native modules
- `get-windows` — MIT
- `koffi` / `@koromix/koffi-*` — MIT; used for Win32 foreground-window calls,
  including the native Windows ARM64 build.
- `sharp` — Apache-2.0; see the Sharp/libvips section for native payload terms

## Apache-2.0 components
Some dependencies (e.g. `sharp`) are Apache-2.0, which requires retaining their
copyright, license, and any `NOTICE` file contents. The release process collects
these from the exact installed dependency tree into
`resources/compliance/THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.txt` and fails if any package lacks
reviewed license material.

## Generating a complete license manifest
To validate installed package notices without downloading corresponding source:

```sh
npm run compliance:licenses
```

All `npm run dist*` commands run the full `npm run compliance:prepare` process
automatically. Electron Builder's `afterPack` hook refuses to create an
installer if the bundle is incomplete or if a build output directory was
recursively packaged.
