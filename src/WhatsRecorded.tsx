          This tool records your screen and activity so it can turn what you did into a reusable
          skill. Here is exactly what it captures and what leaves your computer.
        </p>

        <section className="sheet-block">
          <h3>While you're recording</h3>
          <p className="sheet-note">Only between Start and Stop.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Which apps you switch to, and their window and document titles.</li>
            <li>Web addresses of the pages you open.</li>
            <li>A short preview of text you copy, up to 120 characters.</li>
            <li>A silent video of your screen at a low frame rate.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="sheet-caution">
            If you copy something sensitive like a password while recording, its preview is captured.
            Stop the recording or avoid copying secrets during a session.

          <p className="sheet-note">
            Off by default. Choose the initial state and microphone with Narrate, then use the
            floating recording bar.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Enabling Narrate briefly opens and releases the microphone so the app can request
              permission and show the available inputs. No audio is saved during this check.
            </li>
            <li>Your microphone audio is saved only while it is on and a recording is running.</li>
            <li>
              Turning the microphone off ends that voice segment and releases the device. Turning it
              on again, or switching inputs, starts a new segment linked to the same recording
              timeline.
            </li>
            <li>
              The recording can be turned into text on this computer using an offline model. The
              transcript stays in the language you select from Whisper's 99 supported choices. The
              first transcription needs a one-time ~252 MB download that you choose when to start.
            </li>
            <li>Leave Narrate and the recording-bar microphone off and no microphone is opened.</li>

          <h3>Where it's stored</h3>

            <li>Recordings stay until you delete them. You can delete any recording from Sessions.</li>

            <li>
              When you choose Analyze, the timeline, the recorded events, screenshots from your
              video, and your narration text (if you recorded any) are sent to a Copilot AI model so
              it can describe what you did.

            <li>It only captures while a recording is running. Nothing runs in the background.</li>
