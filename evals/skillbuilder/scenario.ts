// SKILL.md plan. It exists to exercise the richer skill *plan* shape the builder now
// proposes: fixed **values** referenced from step text as `{{id}}` tokens, and an
// ordered list of typed `steps` (calculation vs action, each with its native tool and
// an optional confirmation pause). Like the automation harness, each scenario ships a
// FIXED approved analysis so a failure points at the builder, not the describer.
